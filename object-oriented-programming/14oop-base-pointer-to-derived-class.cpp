    We have made a BaseClass pointer point to an instance of the DerivedClass. This is not 
    throwing an error because `derivedInstance` is actually a type of BaseClass,
    ! albeit with some extra members of its own. 

    ? NOTE that we can only use this pointer to access data members and member functions inherited
    ? FROM the BaseClass ( by the DerivedClass ).

    //? using a pointer of type `BaseClass`
    baseClassPointer -> displayBase();

    /*
    * 2. Accessing member functions of `BaseClass` using `baseClassPointer` which points to instance of `DerivedClass`

    Above, we have defined the member function `test()` in both BaseClass and DerivedClass.

    When we try to access `test()` member function using the baseClassPointer pointing 
    to the instance of the Derived Class, name lookup is only done among the members which 
    have been inherited from `BaseClass` BY `derivedInstance` because we are using pointer
    of type `BaseClass`. 

    ? Which is why when we try to run the below code, the function call is resolved to
    ? the definition of `test()` inside the BaseClass and NOT the DerivedClass.
