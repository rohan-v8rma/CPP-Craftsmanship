/*
* 1. Properties of Constructors

A constructor is a special type of member function of a class which initializes objects of a class. 

In C++, Constructor is automatically called when object(instance of class) is created. 
? It is special member function of the class because it DOES NOT HAVE ANY RETURN TYPE.

! NOTE: Members of a class are by default private. 
! When we explicitly create a constructor under the class, it is private

* 2. Implicitly Defined Constructors

However, when we don't define a constructor explicitly:

? From C++11 standard 12.1.5:

If there is no user-declared constructor for class X, a constructor having no parameters is 
implicitly declared by default. An implicitly-declared default constructor is 
an inline public member of its class.

? and 12.8.7, 12.8.11:

If the class definition does not explicitly declare a copy constructor, one is declared implicitly. 
[...] An implicitly-declared copy [...] constructor is an inline public member of its class.

? and finally 12.8.18, 12.8.20, 12.8.22:

If the class definition does not explicitly declare a copy assignment operator, one is declared implicitly. 
[...] If the definition of a class X does not explicitly declare a move assignment operator, one 
will be implicitly declared [...]. 
An implicitly-declared copy/move assignment operator is an inline public member of its class.

* 3. Best practice of Default Constructors

Whenever we define one or more non-default constructors ( with parameters ) for a class, 
a default constructor ( without parameters ) should also be explicitly defined as the compiler 
will not provide a default constructor in this case. 

Although, it is not necessary but itâ€™s considered best practice to always define a default constructor.

    B. Copy Constructor
    C. Parameterized Constructor

/*
* A. Default Constructor
A constructor which doesn't take any arguments is known as the default constructor
*/

class First_Point_Class {
    private:
        int x, y;
    public:
        First_Point_Class() {
            x = 0;
            y = 0;
        };
};

/*
* B. Copy Constructor
A copy constructor is a member function which initializes an object 
using another object of the same class.

? Note that it is necessary to pass objects by reference in copy constructors always

Because, when we pass an object of the same class BY VALUE to the copy constructor, 
we need to make a copy of the passed object(since we are passing BY VALUE). 
To do that we have to call the copy constructor. 

But to do that, we need to make a new value, so we call the copy constructor, and so on...

(We would have infinite recursion because "to make a copy, you need to make a copy".)
*/

/*
* C. Parameterized Constructor
We can add parameters to constructors just like any other function. 
These parameters help initialize an object when it is created.
*/

    private: 
        int x, y;

            x = reference_point.x + 1;
            y = reference_point.y + 1;
        }; //! We can also use the C method of pass by reference over here.

        //? Reason for passing objects by reference to the copy constructor is mentioned above.

Now, when we create an object using this class, we can give parameters,
