/*
* Constant Objects

Like member functions and member function arguments, the objects of a class can also be declared as CONST. 

? An object declared as const cannot be modified and hence, can invoke only CONST member functions 
? as these functions ensure not to modify the object. 

A const object can be created by prefixing the const keyword to the object declaration. 
Any attempt to change the data member of const objects results in a compile-time error.

* Constant Functions

A function becomes const when the const keyword is used in the functionâ€™s declaration. 
? The idea of const functions is not to allow them to modify the object on which they are called. 
It is recommended the practice to make as many functions const as possible so that accidental changes 
to objects are avoided.

Following is a simple example of a const function.
