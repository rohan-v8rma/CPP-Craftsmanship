/*
In program above, the return type of function test() is ( int& ).

Hence this function returns by reference.
    
The return statement is return globalVar; 

but unlike return by value, this statement doesn't return value of `globalVar`, instead it returns variable `globalVar` itself.

! NOTE that in C, when the return type was `int*`, we had to return an address of a variable which had already been passed by reference into the function.

? Here, we just have to return the variable which had already been passed by reference using the C++ method ( int& ).

? Unlike, the C method where the returned value was actually bound by address to the original variable, here, only a reference is returned, meaning we can replace the function call at the places, where the variable itself is used.

Then the variable `globalVar` is represented by the left side of the assignment operatation, 

test() = 5; 

assigning 5 to `globalVar`.
