2. #define preprocessor directive



* INTRO. What are preprocessor directives?
Statements that begin with # sign - are directives for the preprocessor.
That means these statements are processed before compilation takes place.
! These preprocessor directives don't require semi-colon delimiters at the end of them.

* 1. #include preprocessor directive

The #include<iostream> statement tells the compiler's preprocessor to 
include the header file 'iostream'.

* 2. #define preprocessor directive

    The #define preprocessor directive is used to define constant 
    or macro substitution. It can use any basic data type.
    
    TODO refer 05-B-Macros.cpp for usage examples
