* 1. Arrays in C
Arrays in C can store homogenous data like only
The numpy API in python uses C arrays which is why it is so fast.

? SYNTAX of Declaring an array:
    <datatype-of-stored-elements> <array-name>[<number-of-elements>];
? SYNTAX of Initializing an array:
    <datatype-of-stored-elements> <array-name>[<number-of-elements>] = {<array>};

! NOTE: When we assign a value to a variable while declaring it, it is called INITIALIZATION.
! If we declare it first and assign a value to it later, it is called ASSIGNMENT.

* 2. Static Allocation

Static Allocation is when we enter a numerical value directly
indicating the length of the array we are declaring. 
? For example:
?     int arr[30];
Here, we are directly specifying a numerical value as the length of the array

/*
TODO: 3. Dynamic Allocation

When we use pointers and dynamically allocate space for our array, it is called
Dynamic Allocation.
