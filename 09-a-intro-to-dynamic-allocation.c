/*
* 1. What is Dynamic Memory Allocation?

Dynamic Memory Allocation is a way in which the size of a data structure can be changed during the
runtime, from the HEAP segment.
In C, we use pointers and various other functions in order to dynamically allocate space for our array
It is more efficient that STATIC Allocation.

* 2. Need for Dynamic Memory Allocation

When the data we need to store is dynamic in nature,
we always end up over or under-allocating storage space. 

When:
? Amount of data can't be predicted beforehand
OR
? Number of data items keeps changing during program execution
Dynamic allocation of memory proves to be useful.
