/*
* 1. Arithmetic Operators

* a. Binary Operators

To do arithmetic, C++ uses operators. It provides for 5 basic arithmetic
calculations : addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and remainder
which are +,-,*,/ and % respectively.
Each of these operators is a binary operator i.e., it requires two values (operands)
to calculate a final answer.

+, -, * : work as expected. The operands may be of integer or float types
% : works as expected. But both operands can only be of integer type.
/ : works as expected. Operands may be of int, float or double types.

* b. Unary operators
Apart from these binary operators, C++ provides two unary arithmetic operators,
(that require one operand) also, which are unary + and unary -

Unary + : It precedes an operand.
Unary - : It precedes an operand as well. It reverses the sign of the operand's
value.
