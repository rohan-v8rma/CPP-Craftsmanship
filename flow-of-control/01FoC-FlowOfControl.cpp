? 1. About statements and null statement

Statements are the instructions given to the computer to perform any kind
of action, be it data movements, be it making decisions or be it repeating 
actions. 
Statements form the smallest executable unit within a C++ program. 
Statements are terminated with a semicolon(;). The simplest statement is the
'null' statements. 
For instance,

;   //it is a null statement (notice, it is just a semicolon)

/*
A null statement is useful in those instances where the syntax of the language
requires the presence of a statement but the logic of the program does not.
