/*
! Do-while loop

* Unlike the for and while loop, the 'do-while' loop is an exit-controlled loop i.e., 
* it evaluates its testExpression at the bottom of the loop after executing its loop-body
* statements.

? This means that a do-while loop always executes at least once.

In the other two loops, 'for' and 'while', the testExpression is evaluated at the beginning 
of the loop i.e., before executing the loopBody. 
If the test expression evaluates to false for the first time itself, the loop is never executed.

* But in some situations, it is wanted that the 'loopBody' is executed atleast once, no matter what
* the initial state of the 'testExpression'.

In such cases, the do-while loop is the obvious choice.
