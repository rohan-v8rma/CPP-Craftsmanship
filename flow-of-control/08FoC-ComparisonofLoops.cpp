/*
Though C++ loops can be used in almost all situations, yet there are some
situations, when one loop fits better than the other.

* The 'for' loop is appropriate when you know in advance how many times the loop
* will be executed.

? The other two loops 'while' and 'do-while' loops are more suitable in the situations
? it is not known before-hand when the loop will terminate.


! The 'while' should be preferred when you may not want to execute the loop even once
! (in case the testCondition is false),
? and the 'do-while' loop should be preferred when you're sure you want to execute
? the loopBody at least once.

? The 'do-while' loop is a good choice when you are asking a question, whose answer
? will determine if the loop is to be repeated or terminated.

* These are not hard-and-fast rules. The choice of a loop should actually depend 
* upon the point that the loop should make your program the clearest to understand
* and easiest to follow.
