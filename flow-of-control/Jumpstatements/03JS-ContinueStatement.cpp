* Continue Statement

The continue statement is another jump statement like the break statement as both
the statements skip over a part of the code.

But the continue statement is somewhat different from break, in the fact that
instead of forcing termination, it forces the next iteration of the loop to take
place, skipping any code in between.

! For the 'for' loop, 'continue' causes the next iteration by updating the variable
! and then causing the testExpression's evaluation.

? For the 'while' and 'do-while' loops, the program control passes to the conditional 
? tests.
