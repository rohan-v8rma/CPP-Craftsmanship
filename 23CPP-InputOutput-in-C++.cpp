Variables have to be declared
before we are able to use them in the program. In the above statement we have declared 3 variables of integer data type.
Initialization is when we assign the first starting value to a variable.
NOTE:- If we don't initialize a variable and only declare it, it won't be empty, it will contain junk values left over from the program that last used the
memory they occupy now, until places a value at that memory location.
But, in some implementations, there is some specific default value for each data type.
For e.g:- 0 for int and float, '' for char etc

'cin' is an istream class object tied to standard input.
cin stands for console input.

Stream extraction operator, >>, signifies "extract the next value" from the stream named cin and assign it to the next named variable

get() function is an input function. It fetches a single character and stores it in a character variable.
